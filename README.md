# dungeons-dragons-demographics
Generate demographics for fantasy realms using rules from D&amp;D 3.5

This project uses the random city generation rules found in the v3.5 Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide to create demographic summaries of fantasy regions. It is possible to see breakdowns by race, class, level, and settlement size. 

Planned features:
- Clean output
- User-configurable parameters
